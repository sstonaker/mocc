# Mocc

==========

Mocc is an algorithmic learning package for Python.

When learning Python as a first programming language, some algorithms, data structures, and their respective operations
may be confusing and feel "un-pythonic" due to how they are implemented within Python.

This package was created to provide a sandbox of naive classes and functions that will emphasize the importance
of efficient algorithms and data structures.

Mocc provides an easy to use `@timing` decorator for users to compare and experiment within their sandbox.
